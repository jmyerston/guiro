 Many think that Pythagoras was the son of Mnesarchus,  but they differ as to the latter 's race ; some thinking him a Samian,  while Neanthes,  in the fifth book of his Fables states he was a Syrian,  from the city of Tyre.  As a famine had arisen in Samos,  Mnesarchus went thither to trade,  and was naturalized there.  There also was born his son Pythagoras,  who early manifested studiousness,  but was later taken to Tyre,  and there entrusted to the Chaldeans,  whose doctrines he imbibed.  Thence he returned to Ionia,  where he first studied under the Syrian Pherecydes,  then also under Hermodamas the Creophylian who at that time was an old man residing in Samos.
