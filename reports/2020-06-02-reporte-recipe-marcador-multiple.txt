On an adaptation of custom recipe "marcador.py" as "marcadormultiple.py"

J. DÃ¡vila

I'm reporting on variants of the recipes to allow for 1) texts with paragraphs and 2) process multiple patterns read from a separate file. 


For 1) we now have the recipe load_text_by_paragraph.py which can be invoked like this:

prodigy load_text ./txt -F load_text_by_paragraph.py > books2.jsonl

to store all the contents on all the files in the directory ./txt into a json file with each paragraph tagged as a separate text. It assumes that the original txt files have the paragraphs separated by at least one line with \n. 

For 2) marcador.py has been changed into marcadomultiple.py, and can be invoked as:

prodigy marcador settwo ./books2.jsonl ./patterns -F ./marcadormultiple.py 

It assumes that the directory at ./patterns contains at least a .txt file with the patterns. The output of the processing is eventually written into the prodigy DB but also into the all_relations.csv file in tha format. 

There are some issues with patterns that still do not work. I have put some example which do work in the repository at examples/patterns/patterns.txt


end of report
