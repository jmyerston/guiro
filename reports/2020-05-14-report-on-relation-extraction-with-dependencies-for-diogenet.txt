On the extraction of dependency relations in Diogenet

J. DÃ¡vila

As promised, this is a short manual to guide the use of a script to extract
relations from text using dependency patterns. The script is in the repository

relation_extraction_diogenet.py

But, as a methodological strategy, I recommend the use of this other script
to first display, with displacy, the actual tree for a whole sentence:

spacy-dependency-tree.py

to be able to see the relations before encoding them. I have encoded the following
7, related to the went_to relations in the Porphyry book.

#1 example = "taken|auxpass|was taken|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_TWO"
#2 example = "returned|nsubj|ENTITY_ONE returned|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_TWO"
#x example = "sailing|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_ONE took|nsubj|ENTITY_TWO took|dobj|ENTITY_THREE"
#3 example = "took|nsubj|ENTITY_TWO took|dobj|ENTITY_THREE"
#3a example = "sailing|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_ONE"
#x example = "sailing|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_ONE took|nsubj|ENTITY_TWO"
#x example = "opened|nsubj|ENTITY_ONE returning|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_TWO"
#4 example = "Returning|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_TWO"
#5 example = "returned|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_TWO"
#6 example = "Going|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_ONE"
example = "went|nsubj|ENTITY_ONE went|prep|to to|pobj|ENTITY_TWO"

which are inspired by the following sentences

#1 sent = "There also was born his son Pythagoras, who early manifested studiousness, but was later taken to Tyre, and there entrusted to the Chaldeans, whose doctrines he imbibed."
#2 sent = "Thence he returned to Ionia, where he first studied under the Syrian Pherecydes, then also under Hermodamas the Creophylian who at that time was an old man residing in Samos."
#3 sent = "On sailing to Italy, Mnesarchus took the youth Pythagoras with him."
#4 sent = "Returning to Ionia, he opened in his own country, a school, which is even now called Pythagoras's Semicircles, in which the Samians meet to deliberate about matters of common interest."
#5 sent = "Pythagoras then, longing to be with Hermodamas the Creophylian , returned to Samos."
#6 sent = "Going to Crete, Pythagoras besought initiation from the priests of Morgos, one of the Idaean Dactyli, by whom he was purified with the meteoritic thunder-stone."
sent = "Pythagoras then went to Delos, to visit the Syrian Pherecydes, formerly his teacher, who was dangerously sick, to nurse him."

the images of the trees can be seen in png files in the repository. 

There are many variants to be explored, like the use of lemmas instead of the
actual words and the mixtures of lower and uppercases. The code is underdeveloped
for those cases and it is not easy to extend.

But we can start creating patterns to test them with the texts in preliminary
fashion.

Let us talk about that.

End of the report.
