"""Using the parser to recognise your own semantics

spaCy's parser component can be used to trained to predict any type of tree
structure over your input text. You can also predict trees over whole documents
or chat logs, with connections between the sentence-roots used to annotate
discourse structure. In the original example, they build a message parser for a common
"chat intent": finding local businesses. Our message semantics will have the
following types of relations: ROOT, PLACE, QUALITY, ATTRIBUTE, TIME, LOCATION.

"show me the best hotel in berlin"
('show', 'ROOT', 'show')
('best', 'QUALITY', 'hotel') --> hotel with QUALITY best
('hotel', 'PLACE', 'show') --> show PLACE hotel
('berlin', 'LOCATION', 'hotel') --> hotel with LOCATION berlin

Compatible with: spaCy v2.0.0+

In the adaptation, we learn a parser for the relations "son of" and "nationality" and
 "from city".
